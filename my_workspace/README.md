To launch the different tutorials: 
tutorial 1: ros_visuals/launch/launch.py  (as described in the tutorial)
tutorial 2: talos_rviz.launch.py (also in ros_visuals package)
tutorial 3: talos_control_launch.py (also in ros_visuals package)
tutorial 4: whole_body_control/launch/launch.py -- Please edit the launch.py for the respective exercises (Line 85-89) for the respective Exercise.
tutorial 5: The same as tutorial 4. 


The plots for tutorial 4/5 are saved in src/whole_body_control/plots. In the end I did some filtering to have nicer plots. During debugging I also used the "raw" version of the plots

The answers to the tutorials are saved in "answers.txt", which is in my_workspace directroy
